This Prince of Persia mod uses SDLPoP, David's open source port of Prince of Persia V1.0.
To run the game on Windows, simply double-click the prince.exe executable.
DOSBox is not needed.

In order to run the mod on Linux or Mac, you can compile the game from source (included).
Norbert is also providing a compiled Linux version at popot.org: (thanks, Norbert!)

SPECIAL FEATURES
================

Notable SDLPoP features that are also enabled for this mod:

- You can quicksave the game by pressing F6, and quickload by pressing F9.
- Many of SDLPoP's gameplay fixes and enhancements have been enabled.
  This means that the gameplay will be overall less buggy, compared to the original Prince of Persia.
  Some 'tricks' that depend on glitches have been disabled.

In addition, the mod has various special features, including:

- New potion types, special events and secret easter eggs.
- Multiple endings.
- New special game modes ('practice' mode, 'time attack' mode).

You can play in 'practice' mode by pressing Ctrl+P on the splash screen or title screen.
This allows you to practice levels individually. You will return to the title screen after finishing the level.

You can play in 'time attack' mode by pressing Ctrl+T on the splash screen or title screen.
This is a special challenge mode, where you have 30 minutes at the start.
You will need to collect bonus potions (grey potions) to replenish time along the way.
This game mode is intended for advanced players who are already familiar with all of the levels.


HELP / LEVEL SOLUTIONS
======================

Some general advice:

- You can take your time to explore the levels! This may help to understand the layout, and could give you new ideas.
- If it looks like a puzzle has no solution, you may be able to skip it, and perhaps come back later.
- In some parts, there are acrobatics sequences that are not easy to get right in one try...
  But you can practice these sequences! Remember that you can quicksave the game using F6, and quickload using F9.
- Sometimes, preparation is key. (Look out for loose floor tiles, guards etc. that you can use to your advantage!)
- If you want to practice a particular level individually, you can use 'practice' mode (Ctrl+P on the title screen).

If you really get stuck and want to know the solution for a level, take a look at the solutions document located here:
