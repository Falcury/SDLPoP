Level solutions - Secrets of the Citadel, v1.2

Warning:
The following contains heavy spoilers!


Here you can find the solutions to the levels.
Also, if you scroll further down, you will find instructions on how to reach all of the secrets in this mod.



LEVEL SOLUTIONS
===============

LEVEL 1
Skip the life potion at first. Go down to the bottom-left corner of the level, then make your way up to get the sword.
After opening the exit door, you should have one hitpoint left, which is not enough to reach the exit.
(The level exit door is the same as the level entry door!)
Get the life potion, drop further down and revisit the path towards where the sword was.
Now the gate in the room with the exit door will be permanently open, allowing you to win the level.

LEVEL 2
In the room on the left, you can optionally push the light blue guard into the spikes to save time later on.
Go to the right, then drop down two rooms and follow the upward path on the right side of the level.
You will want to get rid of the light blue guard near the exit door, so he will not pose a problem later on.
Trigger the raise button in the room above the entry door, then quickly drop down and follow the path to the left.
You will have enough time to make it through the gate to reach the leftmost part of the level.
After following that path, you will find the life potion and the raise button for the exit door.

LEVEL 3
Make your way down to the bottom section of the level. There you need to pass a closed gate to the left.
There are two raise buttons that can both be used to pass that gate.
One option is to go a few rooms to the right (past the spike field), then down, where you will find the raise button.
If you use this strategy you will need to be quick, because the gate will not stay permanently open.
Also note that it may help to plan in advance which loose tiles you will/won't use to quickly jump over the spikes.
The other raise button for this gate is located at the far bottom left corner of the level.
To open the gate: ignore the grey potion, drop the loose tile onto the button and immediately jump over the closer.
Having passed this gate and triggered the exit door (avoid the skeleton using a long jump), move to the room above.
The raise button here unlocks the top right part of the level - be sure to drop the loose floor on top of it.
In the next room, push the skeleton over the edge and use a well timed running jump to avoid the chomper past the gap.
Then you can follow the rest of the path up to the top right, until you can drop down into the room with the exit door.

LEVEL 4
Follow the path to the left. From the room with two gates and a chomper, you can do a long jump to the right.
Defeat the red/brown guard here and go to the next room. Trigger the raise button here and turn back to pass the gate.
(Take care to leave enough of the loose tiles, so you can jump back to the left side of the room!)
Behind this gate is the raise button for the exit door. Having triggered that, jump back to the right across the gap.
You can then pass the gate in the room below. (If necessary, you can first climb up and use the raiser again.)
Climb up a few rooms, turn left and defeat the orange guard. Drop down to the loose tile, facing left.
Moving left to the room where the red/brown guard was, carefully jump through the mirror that has appeared.
Now make your way back to the beginning of the level. Climb further up and defeat the dark blue guard.
Jump toward the raise button on the left, drop the loose floor in the ceiling and move to the room above.
Drink the feather potion here and use it to cross the gap, then run to the right.
If necessary, you can use the second feather potion across the large gap to safely fall down to the exit door.

LEVEL 5
There are various possible solutions to this level. All of them involve the following sequence:
You should make your way to the bottom right part of the level and stealthily pass the green guard there.
Then, climb up until you reach the room where the shadowman appears (to drink the empty potion there).
The shadowman will trigger some of the raise buttons, which gives you the opportunity to trigger the level exit.
(In the shadowman room, the button behind the gate on the bottom right triggers the exit door.)
After opening the door, you can use one of the available paths to climb to the exit in the top right part of the level.
Depending on which route you took, some paths may be open or closed after the encounter with the shadow.
It may be helpful to plan in advance how you will navigate the level.

LEVEL 6
Ignore the room where the shadow appears and go right, making your way down to the room with the fat guard.
Instead of killing the guard, evade him and leave him in that room, following the path further to the right and up.
You will then need to open the closed gate that blocks the passage to the upper part of the level.
To do this, open the gates to the right, jump to the right, trigger the raise button there and quickly move back.
After climbing up further, you can permanently trigger the raise button here by letting a loose floor fall.
This button opens the left gate in the room where the fat guard is. Make your way back there.
Lure the fat guard to the room on the left. Kill him on the raise button there (to open the higher gate in that room).
To reach the gate you just opened, drop down to it from the room with the three chompers. (Revisit the earlier path)
Pressing the raise button there will allow you to reach the exit of the level.

LEVEL 7
Use any of the paths to make your way to the bottom of the level, where you will need to open a gate to the left.
Behind that gate is the section of the level that contains the raise button for the exit door.
The gate's raise button is located in the same room; to make the gate stay open, you need to drop the loose floor above.
To reach this loose floor, climb all the way to the upper right part of the level, then jump to the room on the left.
There, instead of going left past the gate that you can open here, go down to the passage below.
You'll find the loose tile there, allowing you to open the gate to access the bottom left part of the level.
If you jump toward that gate coming from the left, you need to have just one intact loose floor tile present there.
Be careful not to trigger the close button in the next room - you need to exit the same way you came!
Also, don't touch the loose floors just yet. You need these as well, for returning later using running jumps.
Carefully make it to the button that raises the level door (using a standing jump).
You'll need to lose two more hitpoints (from falling) to get back. If necessary, there's a health potion to the left.
Use the same path you took earlier via the top right of the level to eventually reach the exit door.

LEVEL 8
Having explored the level, you may be left wondering how to finish it.
The exit (all the way to the right) can only be reached using a raise button all the way to the left!
You will need to scout along the entire bottom path to remove obstacles that slow you down (spikes, closers, guards).
Eventually, you will reach the button that raises the exit door. The mouse will then open the path to the exit.
Much of your task in this level involves 'preparing' for that sequence, so you can move smoothly to the exit.
In the lower right part of the level, you can drop various loose tiles to make the last few running jumps easier.
The light blue guard there can be mostly ignored.
Further to the left, there are more loose floors that need to be dropped at some point, to disable close buttons.
I would recommend luring the yellow guard one room to the right, so you can kill him on the close button there.
The raise button in the room with the orange guard can be used to access the raiser for the top left part of the level.
Having reached the top left part of the level, you can drop down to the room where the exit door button is.
To remove one last obstacle, you can drop the loose floor in the room to the right, which disables some spikes.
Then, jump to the left to trigger the exit. Jump to the right and wait for the mouse to appear.
After the gates are opened for you, run straight to the exit, doing running jumps as often as possible.
If you set up everything correctly beforehand, it should turn out easier than it looks!

LEVEL 9
Go left and follow the path up and to the right, past the purple guard and past the exit door.
Press the raise button on the right and quickly go left, dropping back down into the starting room, and go right.
Kill the yellow guard, making sure that you end up on the right side of the closing gate so you can jump the gap.
Ignore the gates in the next room and drop down to the room below.
(Eventually, in the room below that, you will need to raise the three closed gates to reach the exit door trigger.)
You can either fight or avoid the guard in the room on the left. But make sure the raise button there is not released.
Move further to the left. Touching one of the many closers here is unavoidable.
Climb two floors up and approach the red/brown guard, who will fall on top of the first of the crucial raise buttons.
Now you will need to escape this area back to the right. It helps to make some of the loose floors fall here.
Jump your way to the leftmost gate (opened by the raise button) - you may need to practice this a number of times.
After pressing the raise button in the room on the left, quickly turn back and navigate to the gate opened to the right.
Having 'cleared' the lower left part of the level, now proceed to the right.
A few rooms to the right, go down to encounter the green guard. Go left to drop the second raise button, then turn back.
You may not be able to return to the 'three gates' immediately. In that case, head up instead.
Following the path to the left, make sure the gate in the next room opens properly before dropping down to pass it.
Drop down to the room below, where you were earlier. From here, you can drop down again to the 'three gates' area.
The third raise button is close by (in the room on the left). However, this gate will not stay permanently open.
You need to move fast here (the sequence will need practice). Trigger the raise button and quickly pass the chomper.
When encountering the orange guard guarding the exit button, push him back onto the button, then immediately retreat.
You should have just enough time to climb back under the closing gate.
After triggering the exit door, follow the path through the upper right part of the level.
This time, after dropping down to the room with the (now opened) gates and buttons, press the buttons, then move left.
Quickly make your way back to the room where the level entry door is, and proceed through the closing gate on the left.
Now you can reach the open exit door.

LEVEL 10
Go left and up to the area with the many gates. Go through the upper left gate and defeat the purple guard.
Now make you way to the feather potion in the same room. Be careful to keep the loose floor tile intact here.
Drink the feather potion and climb up using the loose floor tile, then use running jumps to the right to cross the gaps.
Climb further to the top right part of the level.
After dropping down into the room with the exit door, use the raise button for the exit behind the gate on the right.

LEVEL 11
There are a few possible approaches in this level. Here is one that works:
Kill the orange guard on the right, press the raise button and pass the gate to the left.
Climb up to where the yellow guard is and drop the loose floor (you'll need to return later to beat him).
In the room below, press the raise button so the gate on the lower floor starts opening.
Go down there, luring the light blue guard to the room to the right. Don't kill the guard yet and leave him there.
Also, do not drop the loose floor over the raise button there yet (this makes things easier later on).
Climb up and alert the yellow guard by bumping into the wall from the right.
Then, make your again to the room with the yellow guard, this time coming from behind so you can beat him.
Go up, defeat the green guard and drop back down to the room below.
The loose floors in the room can now be dropped to make the gate below stay permanently open.
Also, to the right there is a path that allows you to keep the first gate open. (This is optional, may save time.)
You can also move to the room on the left. There, drop the ceiling tile onto the spikes to disable them.
Moving on from there, you can climb to the top of the level, where you can fall onto the remaining loose tile.
That tile will fall onto a raiser that keeps one of the other gates open in the bottom part of the level.
Now return to the light blue guard you left earlier and lure him all the way to the left, so he keeps a gate open.
Return to the upper floor of this room. Now drop both loose floors above the raise buttons in this room.
Finally, kill the light blue guard on the center raise button, so the upper path in this room is fully cleared.
Passing all the gates on the upper level, you will find the raise button for the level exit, as well as the exit itself.

LEVEL 12
Make your way to the raise button in the entry room, which opens the upper gate on the right.
Carefully duck under the gate and crawl past the chomper, and climb to the room above.
In the room to the left, use the loose tile to help you get to the top floor. Use the raise button there.
This opens the lower left gate, which you can reach by passing the loose floors and chomper below.
Behind that gate, drop the loose floor above the raise button, then return the way you came.
In the room below, the path to the left will be clear. Use a well timed running jump, avoiding the chompers.
Head straight up to the upper section of the level. Reach the passage to the left by jumping to the ledge from above.
In the next room, you'll encounter the shadowman. Instead of reuniting, lure him to the previous room.
Leave the shadow standing on the raise button, so he will keep the gate open in the room above that.
Go there, allow the shadowman to reopen the gate for you, and trigger the exit door button.
Now you can reunite with the shadowman. Use the hidden floors to make it to the exit door all the way to the left.

LEVEL 13
This level is quite straightforward.
Make your way to the right, avoiding the falling floor tiles. Fight the final boss and exit through the exit door.

LEVEL 14
Go to the room of the princess on the left, and enjoy the ending cutscene!



LEVEL SOLUTIONS + SECRETS
=========================


LEVEL 1

1) Level solution
Skip the life potion at first. Go down to the bottom-left corner of the level, then make your way up to get the sword.
After opening the exit door, you should have one hitpoint left, which is not enough to reach the exit.
(The level exit door is the same as the level entry door!)
Get the life potion, drop further down and revisit the path towards where the sword was.
Now the gate in the room with the exit door will be permanently open, allowing you to win the level.

2) Faster but harder route
Get the LP immediately, then follow the normal path to get the sword and open the exit door.
The problem now is: you have only one hitpoint, but the gate in the exit room does not stay permanently open.
However, (after practice) it is in fact possible to quickly escape the tiny space behind that gate, to reach the exit.
Use the raise button in the room to the left of the exit room for this purpose.

3) Finishing the level without getting the sword
Start by getting the LP, then move up to the top-right corner of the level.
Lure the dark blue guard out of the room where the raise button for the exit door is.
Follow the normal path through the level, but skip the sword.
You will not have enough hitpoints to reach the exit easily, so use the method described under 2) to finish the level.


LEVEL 2

1) Level solution
In the room on the left, you can optionally push the light blue guard into the spikes to save time later on.
Go to the right, then drop down two rooms and follow the upward path on the right side of the level.
You will want to get rid of the light blue guard near the exit door, so he will not pose a problem later on.
Trigger the raise button in the room above the entry door, then quickly drop down and follow the path to the left.
You will have enough time to make it through the gate to reach the leftmost part of the level.
After following that path, you will find the life potion and the raise button for the exit door.

2) Finishing the level while not having the sword
If you skipped the sword in level 1, you will still not have it in level 2. This makes the level very challenging!
You should lure the light blue guard on the left near the raise button in the entry room for the gate on the right.
In fact, that raise button also triggers another gate. Go right, down two rooms, then left and you can just make it.
You could lure the orange guard to the raise button in that room, so that he will keep the path to the right open.
This process is very tricky. You might need to bypass the light blue guard again, by jumping past him from behind.
Once you make it to the right part of the level, the rest is a bit more straightforward, but still not easy.
The other light blue guard near the exit room can be lured to the room to the right.
Back in the starting room, the light blue guard should have moved far enough to the right so he will not kill you.
At this point, you could lure him as far as possible to the left, so you can jump over him later.
Once you reach the left part of the level, the remaining guards should be possible to skip as well.
After triggering the exit door and getting the LP, escape the light blue guard one last time and finish the level.


LEVEL 3

1) Level solution
Make your way down to the bottom section of the level. There you need to pass a closed gate to the left.
There are two raise buttons that can both be used to pass that gate.
One option is to go a few rooms to the right (past the spike field), then down, where you will find the raise button.
If you use this strategy you will need to be quick, because the gate will not stay permanently open.
Also note that it may help to plan in advance which loose tiles you will/won't use to quickly jump over the spikes.
The other raise button for this gate is located at the far bottom left corner of the level.
To open the gate: ignore the grey potion, drop the loose tile onto the button and immediately jump over the closer.
Having passed this gate and triggered the exit door (avoid the skeleton using a long jump), move to the room above.
The raise button here unlocks the top right part of the level - be sure to drop the loose floor on top of it.
In the next room, push the skeleton over the edge and use a well timed running jump to avoid the chomper past the gap.
Then you can follow the rest of the path up to the top right, until you can drop down into the room with the exit door.

2) Getting the life potion
You will have noticed that there is no apparent way of opening the gate to the room that contains the LP plus a sword.
The solution is to finish both level 1 and 2 without getting the sword in the first place...
Then, this gate will be automatically opened, allowing you to get both the sword and the LP here.
Note that this is a VERY tricky thing to do (especially passing level 2); it is maybe not worth the trouble!

3) Getting the bonus potion
The bonus potion itself is within easy reach, located at the bottom left corner of the level.
However, drinking the potion here makes it impossible to make the gate you need to pass stay open permanently.
After drinking the potion, you should therefore make your way to the right to use the alternative raise button.
Be aware that you will need to move quickly, so it may be helpful to let some loose floors fall while preserving others.


LEVEL 4

1) Level solution
Follow the path to the left. From the room with two gates and a chomper, you can do a long jump to the right.
Defeat the red/brown guard here and go to the next room. Trigger the raise button here and turn back to pass the gate.
(Take care to leave enough of the loose tiles, so you can jump back to the left side of the room!)
Behind this gate is the raise button for the exit door. Having triggered that, jump back to the right across the gap.
You can then pass the gate in the room below. (If necessary, you can first climb up and use the raiser again.)
Climb up a few rooms, turn left and defeat the orange guard. Drop down to the loose tile, facing left.
Moving left to the room where the red/brown guard was, carefully jump through the mirror that has appeared.
Now make your way back to the beginning of the level. Climb further up and defeat the dark blue guard.
Jump toward the raise button on the left, drop the loose floor in the ceiling and move to the room above.
Drink the feather potion here and use it to cross the gap, then run to the right.
If necessary, you can use the second feather potion across the large gap to safely fall down to the exit door.

2) Getting the life potion
To get the LP, you will need to be fast enough to crawl under the closing gate that guards the passage to it.
Use the second feather potion to jump back and forth across the gap, to reopen the gate.
Then jump to the left, from far enough so you will grab the ledge in front of the spikes. Then crawl under the gate.
You will now be unable to immediately reach the exit door. But you can now also reach it from the other side.
Go back to where the first orange guard was, and go further to the right, eventually climbing back up to the exit room.

3) Alternate exit
In the room where the mirror appeared, if you drop down and go right from there, you will encounter a second level door.
In fact, the raise button for the level exit raises both of the exit doors!
You can use this as an alternate exit, e.g. after getting the LP. (There is no added benefit from using this secret.)
It is harder to reach without getting the LP, because after jumping through the mirror you cannot take fall damage.
However, it is still possible to reach the alternate exit without getting the LP as well.
(Drop the loose floor to the right of the second feather potion. Then go to the room to the left of the mirror room.
One of the gates there will have opened permanently. Use the raise button and jump to the right, to the mirror room.
Here, if you didn't trigger the loose tile earlier, you can now drink the health potion and drop down to the exit.)


LEVEL 5

1) Level solution
There are various possible solutions to this level. All of them involve the following sequence:
You should make your way to the bottom right part of the level and stealthily pass the green guard there.
Then, climb up until you reach the room where the shadowman appears (to drink the empty potion there).
The shadowman will trigger some of the raise buttons, which gives you the opportunity to trigger the level exit.
(In the shadowman room, the button behind the gate on the bottom right triggers the exit door.)
After opening the door, you can use one of the available paths to climb to the exit in the top right part of the level.
Depending on which route you took, some paths may be open or closed after the encounter with the shadow.
It may be helpful to plan in advance how you will navigate the level.

2) Getting the life potion
From the start, go left, trigger the raise button and cross the loose floors.
Jump through the chomper, quickly dropping down. Keep hanging on to the ledge below to drop down with forward momentum.
Climb up past the closing gate, quickly triggering the raise button there and ducking back under the closing gate.
Further down, you should quickly position the purple guard so he gets trapped behind the closing gate there.
Follow the path along the bottom of the level to the right, until you climb up two floors and go to the left again.
You will be then able to reach the LP in the room where the purple guard is keeping the gate open for you.

3) Getting the bonus potion
To reach the bonus potion, you will need to approach it from below (from the room where the shadowman appears).
What makes this difficult is that you also need the shadowman encounter for triggering the level exit door!
To achieve this: exactly before the shadow drinks the empty potion, move back to the previous room.
The shadow will reappear, but can't drink the potion because the loose floor in front of it has already fallen.
As long as the potion is still there and the top left gate is open, the shadow will now repeatedly appear in the room.
By timing this correctly, you will have enough time to climb up to get the bonus potion and be back in time.

4) Getting both the life potion and the bonus potion
After getting the LP, you can climb to the room above and drop a loose tile on a raise button there.
This permanently opens the top right gate in the room where the shadowman appears.
This actually makes getting the bonus potion easier! As the shadow appears, you can 'steal' the potion by drinking it.
This causes the shadowman to exit the room to the right instead of the left - he will trigger the exit door for you!


LEVEL 6

1) Level solution
Ignore the room where the shadow appears and go right, making your way down to the room with the fat guard.
Instead of killing the guard, evade him and leave him in that room, following the path further to the right and up.
You will then need to open the closed gate that blocks the passage to the upper part of the level.
To do this, open the gates to the right, jump to the right, trigger the raise button there and quickly move back.
After climbing up further, you can permanently trigger the raise button here by letting a loose floor fall.
This button opens the left gate in the room where the fat guard is. Make your way back there.
Lure the fat guard to the room on the left. Kill him on the raise button there (to open the higher gate in that room).
To reach the gate you just opened, drop down to it from the room with the three chompers. (Revisit the earlier path)
Pressing the raise button there will allow you to reach the exit of the level.

2) Getting the life potion
The LP can be found in the rightmost part of the level. You will probably need to practice the moves needed to get it!
After raising the gates, a standing jump is preferable to a running jump because you can do it slightly earlier.
After getting the potion, you can do a running jump 'through' the closing gate (slightly later then you might expect).
The shadow potion hidden in this part of the level negates the max life gained by the LP, so it's not a great help...

3) Getting the bonus potion
Find the feather potion located in the room to the right of the room where the bonus potion is.
Raise the gate there. Wait until the gate starts closing, then drink the feather potion.
Quickly climb down and hang on below the closing gate. As soon as the gate is closed, try to climb up into the gate.
This maneuver gives you a bit of forward speed, allowing you to glide to the floor below, where the bonus potion is.

4) Easter egg: shadow potion
Found at the bottom right of the level. Turns you into the shadowman for a short time.
You will be able to move through closed gates, survive falls and walk over loose floors without dropping them.
You lose some life by drinking it, which limits the usefulness. It is really just an easter egg here.

5) Easter egg: shadow encounter
It is possible to reach the shadow in this level. (Although the level ending by falling down there is disabled!)
In the upper right part of the level, in the room with two chompers, you can hit the ceiling to make a loose floor fall.
Then you can use the feather potion in the room next to the starting room to access the leftmost part of the level.
There, a gate will now have permanently opened, allowing you to meet the shadowman.


LEVEL 7

1) Level solution
Use any of the paths to make your way to the bottom of the level, where you will need to open a gate to the left.
Behind that gate is the section of the level that contains the raise button for the exit door.
The gate's raise button is located in the same room; to make the gate stay open, you need to drop the loose floor above.
To reach this loose floor, climb all the way to the upper right part of the level, then jump to the room on the left.
There, instead of going left past the gate that you can open here, go down to the passage below.
You'll find the loose tile there, allowing you to open the gate to access the bottom left part of the level.
If you jump toward that gate coming from the left, you need to have just one intact loose floor tile present there.
Be careful not to trigger the close button in the next room - you need to exit the same way you came!
Also, don't touch the loose floors just yet. You need these as well, for returning later using running jumps.
Carefully make it to the button that raises the level door (using a standing jump).
You'll need to lose two more hitpoints (from falling) to get back. If necessary, there's a health potion to the left.
Use the same path you took earlier via the top right of the level to eventually reach the exit door.

2) Getting the life potion
The room to the right of the starting room contains a life potion.
The gate to it will be opened when you drop the loose floor that also unlocks the bottom left part of the level.
To reach the life potion, follow the path along the upper left part of the level.

3) Getting the bonus potion
The bonus potion is located at the bottom right of the level.
You will need to open the gates using the raise button from the room above, drink the potion and quickly escape.
This requires some tricky acrobatics.
You might be tempted to use the lower gate to try to escape, but in fact this is much harder (might be impossible).
However, this works: after drinking the potion, bump back into the upper gate, then do a standing jump to escape.


LEVEL 8

1) Level solution
Having explored the level, you may be left wondering how to finish it.
The exit (all the way to the right) can only be reached using a raise button all the way to the left!
You will need to scout along the entire bottom path to remove obstacles that slow you down (spikes, closers, guards).
Eventually, you will reach the button that raises the exit door. The mouse will then open the path to the exit.
Much of your task in this level involves 'preparing' for that sequence, so you can move smoothly to the exit.
In the lower right part of the level, you can drop various loose tiles to make the last few running jumps easier.
The light blue guard there can be mostly ignored.
Further to the left, there are more loose floors that need to be dropped at some point, to disable close buttons.
I would recommend luring the yellow guard one room to the right, so you can kill him on the close button there.
The raise button in the room with the orange guard can be used to access the raiser for the top left part of the level.
Having reached the top left part of the level, you can drop down to the room where the exit door button is.
To remove one last obstacle, you can drop the loose floor in the room to the right, which disables some spikes.
Then, jump to the left to trigger the exit. Jump to the right and wait for the mouse to appear.
After the gates are opened for you, run straight to the exit, doing running jumps as often as possible.
If you set up everything correctly beforehand, it should turn out easier than it looks!

2) Getting the bonus potion
The bonus potion is located to the right of the exit door.
To reach it, you will need to be even faster than you already had to be to get to the exit door.
Normally, after pressing the raise button for the exit door, you will be stuck until you are rescued by the mouse.
However, you can make the loose tile in that room fall in advance, so that gate won't close immediately later on.
This makes it possible to wait for the mouse on the other side of that gate. This saves a lot of time.


LEVEL 9

1) Level solution
Go left and follow the path up and to the right, past the purple guard and past the exit door.
Press the raise button on the right and quickly go left, dropping back down into the starting room, and go right.
Kill the yellow guard, making sure that you end up on the right side of the closing gate so you can jump the gap.
Ignore the gates in the next room and drop down to the room below.
(Eventually, in the room below that, you will need to raise the three closed gates to reach the exit door trigger.)
You can either fight or avoid the guard in the room on the left. But make sure the raise button there is not released.
Move further to the left. Touching one of the many closers here is unavoidable.
Climb two floors up and approach the red/brown guard, who will fall on top of the first of the crucial raise buttons.
Now you will need to escape this area back to the right. It helps to make some of the loose floors fall here.
Jump your way to the leftmost gate (opened by the raise button) - you may need to practice this a number of times.
After pressing the raise button in the room on the left, quickly turn back and navigate to the gate opened to the right.
Having 'cleared' the lower left part of the level, now proceed to the right.
A few rooms to the right, go down to encounter the green guard. Go left to drop the second raise button, then turn back.
You may not be able to return to the 'three gates' immediately. In that case, head up instead.
Following the path to the left, make sure the gate in the next room opens properly before dropping down to pass it.
Drop down to the room below, where you were earlier. From here, you can drop down again to the 'three gates' area.
The third raise button is close by (in the room on the left). However, this gate will not stay permanently open.
You need to move fast here (the sequence will need practice). Trigger the raise button and quickly pass the chomper.
When encountering the orange guard guarding the exit button, push him back onto the button, then immediately retreat.
You should have just enough time to climb back under the closing gate.
After triggering the exit door, follow the path through the upper right part of the level.
This time, after dropping down to the room with the (now opened) gates and buttons, press the buttons, then move left.
Quickly make your way back to the room where the level entry door is, and proceed through the closing gate on the left.
Now you can reach the open exit door.

2) Getting life potion #1
The first life potion you can get is the life potion in the bottom left room of the level.
Fair warning: this is probably one of the hardest potions to get, in all of the levels...
Normally, there is no time to get the potion in this room, because the gate would be closing behind you, trapping you.
The only way to get the potion is to make sure that the gate is never closed in the first place!
To achieve this, you need to use another entry to the area with all the close buttons: you can enter from above.
This entry is located in the room to the left of the starting room. A closed gate blocks the passage to it.
You can open this gate by making a loose floor fall from the room above. But you can't immediately return there.
Instead, proceed normally, pass the yellow guard to the right and jump the gap to the next room to the right.
From this room, there is an (incredibly difficult) acrobatics sequence needed to get back to the passage on the left.
Expect practicing this at least a hundred times, because everything needs to be more or less frame-perfect...
In essence, it's about jumping back and forth across the gaps while keeping the gates open one by one...
If you have miraculously made it to the closer area, entering from the 'ceiling' there, you face the next challenge:
You will need to perform another frame-perfect acrobatics sequence to avoid triggering any of the close buttons...
It's next to impossible to get this right without savestates, and even then takes a lot of effort to figure out.
If you do make it to the left-most room without triggering any close button, you will have earned the LP thoroughly.

3) Getting life potion #2
You can reach the second life potion from the top right part of the level.
The area is closed off by two gates. Take care not to touch the two loose floors - those close off one of the gates.
Open the gate to the left, then jump back over the loose floors. Then you need to jump exactly past the spikes.
You need to perfectly align your running jump for this, so that you will just miss the left edge of the raiser tile.
Past the gate on the left, quickly trigger the raise button there and duck back under the closing gate to the right.
Then carefully move to the right, avoiding the spikes and close buttons, past the gates and down to the LP.

4) Getting the bonus potion
The bonus potion can be found to the right of the exit door (across the gap).
It may be most practical to get the potion after you have gone through the rest of the level first.


LEVEL 10

1) Level solution
Go left and up to the area with the many gates. Go through the upper left gate and defeat the purple guard.
Now make you way to the feather potion in the same room. Be careful to keep the loose floor tile intact here.
Drink the feather potion and climb up using the loose floor tile, then use running jumps to the right to cross the gaps.
Climb further to the top right part of the level.
After dropping down into the room with the exit door, use the raise button for the exit behind the gate on the right.

2) Getting the life potion
The life potion is in the bottom left corner of the level.
As long as you approach the orange guard stealthily, it should not be too hard to get it.
You will however need to move fast, so the gate doesn't close behind you, leaving you trapped.

3) Getting the bonus potion
The bonus potion is hidden in plain sight - actually getting it is a multi-step process.
Skip the potion at first and follow the normal path through the level.
In the room with the exit door, you will need to keep the left gate open permanently, so you can return there later.
(The way to do this is to kill the purple guard on the raise button that opens it - not easy.)
To access the bonus potion, you will need to use the raise button again in the room that contained the feather potion.
The only way to do this without the feather potion is to use the lower right gate in this room.
You will find that there is a way to keep that gate permanently open: there is a loose floor right above it!
However, there is also a close button in the room to the right, where the bonus potion is, which makes it harder.
Because you need to press that close button to get back to the left side, don't drop the loose tile at first!
(Avoiding touching that tile while still surviving is difficult, but possible with crouch-hops.)
Returning to the left side of the level via the lowest floors, quickly enter the room where the feather potion was.
Jump through the chompers, trigger the raise button and return in time to duck under the closing gate.
Now climb up to where you can make that crucial loose floor fall. But you will need to go back quickly to the left side.
Because the upper gate shuts behind you immediately, you will have to use the lower gate for this.
To be fast enough: jump to hit the loose tile, do a standing jump, get hit by the tile and land on the debris below.
Now, finally, the lower left gate in this room will stay open, and you are able to access it.
Trigger the gate for the bonus potion one last time and quickly climb up to that gate.
Now the gate should still be open far enough so you can do a running jump to pass the chompers and get the potion.
Return to the 'safety' of the left side of the level. Get to the exit door using the top left part of the level.


LEVEL 11

1) Level solution
There are a few possible approaches in this level. Here is one that works:
Kill the orange guard on the right, press the raise button and pass the gate to the left.
Climb up to where the yellow guard is and drop the loose floor (you'll need to return later to beat him).
In the room below, press the raise button so the gate on the lower floor starts opening.
Go down there, luring the light blue guard to the room to the right. Don't kill the guard yet and leave him there.
Also, do not drop the loose floor over the raise button there yet (this makes things easier later on).
Climb up and alert the yellow guard by bumping into the wall from the right.
Then, make your again to the room with the yellow guard, this time coming from behind so you can beat him.
Go up, defeat the green guard and drop back down to the room below.
The loose floors in the room can now be dropped to make the gate below stay permanently open.
Also, to the right there is a path that allows you to keep the first gate open. (This is optional, may save time.)
You can also move to the room on the left. There, drop the ceiling tile onto the spikes to disable them.
Moving on from there, you can climb to the top of the level, where you can fall onto the remaining loose tile.
That tile will fall onto a raiser that keeps one of the other gates open in the bottom part of the level.
Now return to the light blue guard you left earlier and lure him all the way to the left, so he keeps a gate open.
Return to the upper floor of this room. Now drop both loose floors above the raise buttons in this room.
Finally, kill the light blue guard on the center raise button, so the upper path in this room is fully cleared.
Passing all the gates on the upper level, you will find the raise button for the level exit, as well as the exit itself.

2) Getting the life potion
The life potion is in the room to the left of the exit room.
To get it, you will need to keep the gate open that closes off the access to this area.
The way to do this is to kill a guard (probably the light blue one) on that button. This is tricky, but possible to do.


LEVEL 12

1) Level solution
Make your way to the raise button in the entry room, which opens the upper gate on the right.
Carefully duck under the gate and crawl past the chomper, and climb to the room above.
In the room to the left, use the loose tile to help you get to the top floor. Use the raise button there.
This opens the lower left gate, which you can reach by passing the loose floors and chomper below.
Behind that gate, drop the loose floor above the raise button, then return the way you came.
In the room below, the path to the left will be clear. Use a well timed running jump, avoiding the chompers.
Head straight up to the upper section of the level. Reach the passage to the left by jumping to the ledge from above.
In the next room, you'll encounter the shadowman. Instead of reuniting, lure him to the previous room.
Leave the shadow standing on the raise button, so he will keep the gate open in the room above that.
Go there, allow the shadowman to reopen the gate for you, and trigger the exit door button.
Now you can reunite with the shadowman. Use the hidden floors to make it to the exit door all the way to the left.

2) Getting the life potion
To get the life potion, you will have to jump down there, from the room with the three chompers.
The biggest problem will be to get back up there!
Make sure not to touch any of the close buttons in that section of the level - those will leave you trapped.
Also, you need to do some things in advance.
You can keep the rightmost part of the level open, by dropping the loose tiles (top right corner of the level).
Two rooms from the left from there, you need to make sure that not all loose tiles in the room below are dropped.
(Otherwise, you won't be able to bridge the gap there to get back to the left part of the level.)
Alternatively, you can use the feather potion hidden near the top right of the level to jump back down to the left.

3) Getting the bonus potion
The bonus potion can be found in the top right section of the level.
The gate that blocks access to it is opened simultaneously with the gate in the room below (to the left).
You will just need to be faster! (Of course, it's not so easy...)
There are in fact two raise buttons for this set of gates: the other one is one room to the left (behind the chomper).
If you use this raise button (while there is still a loose floor there), you can jump the gap to the right.
Then you can jump through the first gate (where you had to duck under at the beginning) and make it through the second.
To preserve one loose tile in the room with the raiser and the chomper, use a standing jump there (quite tricky).


LEVEL 13

1) Level solution
This level is quite straightforward.
Make your way to the right, avoiding the falling floor tiles. Fight the final boss and exit through the exit door.

2) Poison potions
For every bonus potion that you drank during your playthrough, one poison potion will turn into an empty potion.
If you see one or more potions with blue bubbles here, it means you missed the corresponding bonus potion!
(There is no way to get rid of them - they just serve as a visual confirmation as to which bonus potions you got.)

3) Alternate boss fight
If you have collected all of the bonus potions in the previous levels, you will fight the skeleton instead of Jaffar.
This skeleton is tougher to defeat than usual: he will parry some blows that other guards can't!


LEVEL 14

1) Level solution
Go to the room of the princess on the left, and enjoy the ending cutscene!

2) Alternate ending / bonus level
If you collected all eight bonus potions earlier, you will get a chance to visit the bonus level.
This final level is quite challenging and has its own unique special events and potions.
Similar to the other levels, you'll need some cleverness to win the level and finish the game!
(I will not provide the full solution to this final level here. But I hope you'll try to beat it!)
