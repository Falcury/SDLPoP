Playing custom levelsets with SDLPoP
====================================

1. Put the folder with the mod's custom files inside this folder (the "mods/" directory).

2. Make sure that the name of the mod directory matches the name of the mod.
   For example: 

   mods/Prince4D/

3. Open SDLPoP.ini and change the value of the 'levelset' option to the name of the mod.
   For example: 

   levelset = Prince4D

4. Launch the game and play!



N.B.: In the mod's directory, only files that have been modified compared to the original game are needed.
