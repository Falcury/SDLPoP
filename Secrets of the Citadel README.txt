This Prince of Persia mod uses SDLPoP, David's open source port of Prince of Persia V1.0.
To run the game on Windows, simply double-click the prince.exe executable.
To start immediately in fullscreen, you can launch start_fullscreen.bat.
DOSBox is not needed.

In order to run the mod on Linux or Mac, you can compile the game from source (included).
Norbert has also provided a compiled Linux version at popot.org: (thanks, Norbert!)
